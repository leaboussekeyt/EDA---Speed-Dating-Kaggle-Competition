# Kaggle-Competiton-Speed-Dating
First project for the Jedha bootcamp participating in the Kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/annavictoria/speed-dating-experiment


## Objective 
From a dataset with numerous data on the result of a speed dating experiment, a multitude of problematics could be followed. This project will particularly focus on how the speed dating experiment influenced the participant's vision of themselves.

## Dataset
The dataset, along with a word document with the explanation of key variables, can be downloaded here: https://www.kaggle.com/annavictoria/speed-dating-experiment. 
Otherwise, those two document are also included in the Data Folder on this repository. 

## Prerequisites

### Dependencies
* The source code is written in Python 3
* The python packages can be installed with pip : pip3 install -R requirements.txt

* If using VSCode, plotly renderer needs to be changed in the code (see comment on code)
